                        <h2>Why You Should Care about That Grain Belt Sign</h2>
                           <p>You’ve probably already heard that Schell’s has bought the iconic Grain Belt Beer sign that overlooks the Mississippi river in Minneapolis. They plan to restore and re-light the sign by 2017. And if you’ve heard that, then you’ve almost definitely heard that Schell’s is planning to brew a new beer to celebrate this acquisition – a copper lager by the name of Lock & Dam Lager under the Grain Belt brand. The promise of a new lager from a brewery putting out some of the best lagers in the state is definitely exciting news. Remember, Schell’s has taken home GABF medals for Firebrick and Oktoberfest. Even Grain Belt won silver in 2014 and gold in 1994. Despite all this, you might be wondering why we should be so excited about them planning to buy and restore an old beer sign. I mean, Grain Belt isn’t on most craft beer lover’s top ten lists. And it is after all, just a rusty old sign.</p>

                       <h2>The Five Most Anticipated New Twin Cities Craft Breweries and Taprooms</h2>
                        <h3>1. 56 Brewing</h3>
                        Opening in the tiny original NorthGate location, 56 Brewing—who will reveal the meaning behind the numerical name when they open—is the city’s first “CSB” brewery, selling membership shares a la a CSA. They will feature an onsite garden and a focus on limiting their carbon footprint. Opening Friday May 1, 2015. 
                        <h3>2 Able Seedhouse and Brewery</h3>
                        Opening in the fall or winter of 2015 in the center of the Northeast Brew District, just blocks between Indeed, Bauhaus, 612, and Sociable Cider Werks, the pressure is already on Able Seedhouse to deliver. They’ll also be malting in-house for some truly 100% Minnesota beers. The head brewer is Bobby Blasey.
                        <h3>3 Angry Inch Brewing</h3>
                        The south metro is behind on the brewery movement, but Angry Inch is looking to bring fresh beer to Lakeville, opening the options and reducing the time spent in the car to find craft beer elsewhere. Head brewers are Jon Erickson and Josh Hebzynski. The brewery expects to open in July.
                        <h3>4 Bryn Mawr Brewing Company</h3>
                        This project has been pretty mum, but co-founder Dan Justesen has said the brewery will start bigger instead of the continual expansion most start-ups face. That also means high expectations. Justesen is an industry vet striking out on his own after previously owning a share of brew-on-premise Vine Park Brewing. He is also Vice President of the MN Craft Brewer’s Guild. Look for a fall/winter opening.
                        <h3>5 Lakes & Legends Brewing Company</h3>
                        Aiming for a summer opening, this new Belgian/farmhouse style brewery will open in the ground level of LPM Apartments (joining neighbor's Eggy's diner), adding some new character and excitement to Loring Park in a unique environment.

<!--Assignment 8 notes
            
       *Requirement 1

            1- Fixed a couple img's that were not flexible after setting the height and width attributes in the img tags. Created an id="img" for both img's and then gave them both a width of 100% 
            .
            2-I added two break points on all pages using media quires. Each page was a little different. The first brake point was between 900-1200 to rearrange columns. The second was at around 320 to stop the screen from collapsing any smaller if the user wanted to make there window smaller.
            
            3-The link's,H2’s and H3’s color was to dark to read with the dark background. Changed those three from darkred to #e60000.
            
            4-Connect the contact page to the server using php.
            
            5-restructered the ontap.html page to make it more interactive. I trashed the scroll bar and replaced it with buttons that display the respective text.
            
        *Requirement 2
            
            I used an event listener to listen for a click on one of the "brew#" elements. Then out put the var data of that function to the "brews" id using innerhtml.
